## 06 - Components

<a name="building_components"></a>
### [Building Components](#building_components)

Let's continue our previous example. We already had a "temperature" component. We'll add a
"conditions" component for the current conditions (sunny, cloudy, rain) so that our initial state is
now:

```js
{
  conditions: {
    precipitations: false,
    sky: "Sunny"
  },
  temperature: {
    value: 22,
    units: "C"
  }
}
```

Each component will separately indicate its initial state and the actions that it provides. At the
top-level app, we'll assemble these together into the complete initial state and set of actions.

For the conditions, we have:

```js
var conditions = {
  initial: {
    conditions: {
      precipitations: false,
      sky: "Sunny"
    }
  },
  Actions: function(update) {
    return {
      togglePrecipitations: function(value) {
        update({ conditions: { precipitations: value } });
      },
      changeSky: function(value) {
        update({ conditions: { sky: value } });
      }
    };
  }
};
```

For the temperature, we have essentially the same code as we previously had.

```js
var temperature = {
  initial: function() {
    return {
      temperature: {
        value: 22,
        units: "C"
      }
    };
  },
  Actions: function(update) {
    return {
      increment: function(amount) {
        update({ temperature: { value: x => x + amount } });
      },
      changeUnits: function() {
        update({
          temperature: state => {
            var value = state.value;
            var newUnits = state.units === "C" ? "F" : "C";
            var newValue = convert(value, newUnits);
            return {
              value: newValue,
              units: newUnits;
            };
          }
        });
      }
    };
  }
};
```

Then, to assemble the components into the top-level app, we put together the state management code
by combining the initial state and the actions of the components.

```js
var app = {
  initial: Object.assign(
    {},
    conditions.initial,
    temperature.initial()
  ),
  Actions: function(update) {
    return Object.assign(
      {},
      conditions.Actions(update),
      temperature.Actions(update)
    );
  }
};
```

Here is the complete example:

In this example, components designate a property for their state (`conditions`, `temperature`). What
if we want to designate a property from outside the component, to make sure there are no conflicts?
Even more significantly, what if we want to have multiple instances of a component?

<a name="using_ids_for_components"></a>
### [Using IDs for Components](#using_ids_for_components)

Whether it's to manage properties from outside of components, or to use multiple instances of a
component, we can use IDs and pass them to components. Then, instead of having a hardcoded property
in the component, the ID is used when reading and updating state.

Continuing the previous example, let's say we want to have two instances of the `temperature`
component: one for the air temperature and one for the water temperature. We want to use the
`temperature:air` and `temperature:water` properties in the application state.

We'll change the actions to accept an `id` parameter. Then, we use the `id` when issuing updates, so
that we dyamically update the `id` property of the state:

```js
Actions: function(update) {
  return {
    increment: function(id, amount) {
      update({ [id]: { value: x => x + amount } });
    },
    changeUnits: function(id) {
      update({
        [id]: state => {
          var value = state.value;
          var newUnits = state.units === "C" ? "F" : "C";
          var newValue = convert(value, newUnits);
          return {
            value: newValue,
            units: newUnits
          };
        }
      });
    }
  };
}
```

Notice the `{ [id]: ... }` syntax which creates an object with a dynamic `id` property.

Now, we create the initial state with two instances of `temperature`, one with `temperature:air` and
one with `temperature:water`. The actions are created the same as before. Indeed, we just need one
instance of the temperature actions; it's the `id` that we pass to the actions that indicates which
instance to act upon.

```js
var app = {
  initial: {
    "conditions": conditions.initial,
    "temperature:air": temperature.initial(),
    "temperature:water": temperature.initial()
  ),
  Actions: function(update) {
    return Object.assign({},
      conditions.Actions(update),
      temperature.Actions(update)
    );
  }
};
```

Here is the complete example:

@flems code/06-components-02.js flyd,mergerino 800

<a name="exercises"></a>
### [Exercises](#exercises)

Try it out: notice that the initial state appears in the output on the right. Within the console,
type and then press Enter:

`actions.changeSky("conditions", "Cloudy")`

`actions.increment("temperature:air", 2)`

`actions.changeUnits("temperature:water")`

In the output on the right, you'll see the updated states.

<a name="state_management_and_view_code"></a>
### [State Management and View code](#state_management_and_view_code)

So far, all we have is state management code; there is no view code. This is on purpose:
we've built our state management code independently. We can trigger actions and see the
updated state. Our code is not tied to any particular view code.

Having independent state management code makes it easier to test and debug. You can organize
and assemble actions as you prefer. For example, if you find that the number of actions in
your application is getting large, you might decide to _namespace_ your actions by grouping
them under properties, such as `actions.conditions.changeSky` and
`actions.temperature.increment`.

The view code is a separate concern. It will display the UI based on the state, and call
actions. No matter which view library you use, it is easy to wire up because views only
depend on `state` and `actions`.

How you group together the code is up to you. In some cases, it might make sense to put state
management and view code together into a folder for a component of your application. In other
cases, you may prefer to have view components separate from the code that manages state.

In the following sections, we will look at wiring up the Meiosis pattern to a handful of
view libraries. Feel free to jump straight to the view library in which you are interested.
