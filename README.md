> It's not a library. It's a simple pattern to manage state in your web applications.

Think Redux, MobX, Cerebral, React Context, etc. but without having library imports everywhere and
being tied to a framework API. Instead, just plain functions and objects.

All you need is a simple stream library such as Flyd or Mithril Stream in one place to implement
the pattern. You do not need anything else, not even Meiosis itself. You could even implement the
stream yourself with a handful of lines of code. Zero dependencies!

Easily use the pattern with your favourite view library: React, Preact, Mithril, lit-html,
and so on.

## Why the name _Meiosis_?

I picked the name **Meiosis** for three reasons:

1. it's a [biology term](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis) for a type of cell division; this is
an analogy to the idea of dividing your application into smaller pieces;
2. it's a [figure of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis_(figure_of_speech) that
_intentionally understates something or implies that it is lesser in significance or size than it
really is_, meaning that this is meant to be small, humble, and not replace what people use,
just improve upon it; and
3. it's a relatively unique name in the JavaScript world, thus making it easy to find information
using search engines.
