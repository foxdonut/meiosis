# Meiosis Documentation Examples

You can run the examples directly on the pages of the Documentation, edit the code and see the results.

You can also run the examples locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/foxdonut/meiosis
cd meiosis/docs
npm i
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000). Edit the source code under the `code`
directory and refresh the page in your browser to see your changes.

You can also use `npm run watch` to automatically rebuild the example when you make changes.
