<h2>Using a Router</h2><p>Coming soon.</p>
<!--

Each section under "Using a Router" shows a way to set up a router pattern. You only need to use the
approach that matches your needs. There is no right or wrong approach. Obviously, you can take one
of the setups and tweak it according to your requirements.

Instead of re-inventing the wheel, a router library is used to do the work of matching URLs to route
paths. You can use a different library by adjusting the pattern setup code to match how your chosen
library works. The following router libraries are used in the examples of this documentation:

- [feather-route-matcher](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/feather-route-matcher)
- [Mithril Router](https://mithril.js.org/route.html)

Here is a summary of the approaches:

- [Basic Pattern Setup](router-setup.html): introduces the pattern and provides a minimal setup that
  uses [feather-route-matcher](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/feather-route-matcher) and hardcoded
  paths in `href`s and actions.
- [Mithril Router](router-mithril.html): shows how to set up the pattern with
  [Mithril Router](https://mithril.js.org/route.html), in case you are already using Mithril and
  want to use its router instead of a separate router library.

Each setup is ready to use, so have a look and pick the setup that most closely matches your
requirements. This mostly comes down to:

- Do you need to use [query strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)?
- Do you prefer to use hardcoded paths (this is easier) or a `toPath` function (this is more
  robust and resilient to changes)?
- Do you want to use [Mithril Router](https://mithril.js.org/route.html) instead of a separate
  router library?
- Do you want to use [tagged unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union) with routes (this
  is also more robust and resilient to changes)?

Let's get started by having a look at the [Basic Pattern Setup](router-setup.html).

### Router Pattern Setup

This section discusses the basic pattern for setting up a router with Meiosis.

#### Route State

To use a router with Meiosis, we'll store the current route in the application state under the
`route` property:

```js
// application state
{
  route: { page: "Home", params: {} },
  // rest of state
}
```

Then, we'll have access to the route via `state.route`. Using this information, a single top-level
view renders the page that corresponds to the route, using a simple key-value lookup:

```js
// The Home component
import { Home } from "../home";

// The Login component
import { Login } from "../login";

const componentMap = {
  Home: Home,  // render the Home component when the route page is "Home"
  Login: Login // render the Login component when the route page is "Login"
}

// in the view's render function
const Component = componentMap[state.route.page];
// render the Component
```

The essential idea is to store the route in the state. Then, we can write our application using the
state just like we have been doing all along.

#### Getting the Current Path

#### Matching a Path to a Route

#### Navigating to a Route

#### Keeping the Location Bar Synchronized

#### The `createRouter` function

Putting everything together, here is our `createRouter` function:

```js
const createRouter = routeConfig => {
  const prefix = "#";

  const getPath = () =>
    decodeURI(window.location.hash || prefix + "/").substring(prefix.length);

  const routeMatcher = createRouteMatcher(routeConfig);

  const initialRoute = routeMatcher(getPath());

  const start = ({ onRouteChange }) => {
    window.onpopstate = () => onRouteChange(routeMatcher(getPath()));
  };

  const locationBarSync = route => {
    const path = route.url;

    if (getPath() !== path) {
      window.history.pushState({}, "", prefix + path);
    }
  };

  const effect = state => {
    locationBarSync(state.route);
  };

  return { initialRoute, routeMatcher, start, locationBarSync, effect };
};
```
