## Examples

The code repository for `meiosis-router` includes examples for both Hash Mode and History Mode.

To try out these examples, first clone the repository and set up the projects by using the commands
below:

```
git clone https://github.com/foxdonut/meiosis
cd meiosis/helpers/router/examples
cd hash-mode
npm ci
cd ../history-mode
npm ci
cd ..
```

Then you can experiment with the Hash Mode and History Mode examples.

For the Hash Mode example:

```
cd hash-mode
```

For the History Mode example:

```
cd history-mode
```

In both cases, to start the example, use:

```
npm start
```

You can then access the example in your browser with this URL: `http://localhost:9000`.

If you would like to experiment with the code, you can auto-load your changes. Open a separate
terminal window, use `cd` to navigate to the example's directory (`hash-mode` or `history-mode`),
and run the following command:

```
npm run watch
```

This will recompile the project when you save your changes. Reload the page in your browser to see
the results of your changes.
