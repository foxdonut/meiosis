## 12 - What's Next?

This concludes the Meiosis documentation. Where do you go from here?

- To use a library instead of setting up the Meiosis pattern yourself, or to get
additional features including TypeScript support and nested services and views, see
[meiosis-setup](https://meiosis.js.org/setup).
- See also more [Examples](https://meiosis.js.org/examples.html).
- The [Meiosis Tracer](https://meiosis.js.org/tracer) is a time-travel development tool.
- Use the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/foxdonut/meiosis) for discussion and to ask questions.

Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoy Meiosis!
